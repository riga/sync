# CMS HH → bb𝝉𝝉 synchronization

This repository contains tools to synchronize frameworks between groups in terms of event yields, categorization, and object definitions.

##### CI

There is a CI running on every commit that does a quick comparison of files and writes several tables and plots.

You can checkout the latest *CI job artifacts* [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/hh/synchronization/-/jobs/artifacts/master/browse/data?job=quick_comparison).

### Setup

When running the synchronization on a machine with access to `/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch` you setup the environment conveniently via

```shell
source setup.sh
```

This sets up a shallow CMSSW checkout with all required software.

You can also run the docker container associated to this repository and configured in [docker/Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile) by doing

```shell
# assuming you are in the root directory of the repository

# start the container
> docker run -ti -v `pwd`:/sync gitlab-registry.cern.ch/hh/synchronization

# in the container, do
kinit YOUR_USER@CERN.CH
```

### Usage

Start the interactive `sync` tool via:

```
sync [arguments]
```

Add ``--help`` to see all possible arguments.

In general, the tool starts an interactive IPython or Python shell, prints some usage information at startup and waits for output.

The first time you start the tool, it will copy or download the synchronization files of all groups defined by in the configuration file set by `--config FILE` (defaults to [config/2018.yml](config/2018.yml)). If you want to reload the files the next time you start the tool, add `--flush`.

As an example, you show the event yields per category (also defined in the config) and participating group in a certain dataset. The full output will look like:

```shell
> sync

...  # ipython welcome message

---------------------------------------------- Usage -----------------------------------------------

print_config()
    Prints a summary of the current configuration.

show_yields(dataset=None)
    Shows the yields for all groups in a specific *dataset*. When *None*, all datases are evaluated
    sequentially.

write_yields(dataset=None)
    Writes the yield tables obtained by :py:func:`show_yields` into a file per dataset in the
    table directory. When *dataset* is *None*, all datasets are evaluated sequentially.

...  # more tools

In [1]: show_yields()

##### Tools

- `print_config()`: Prints a summary of the current configuration.

- `show_yields(dataset=None)`: Shows the yields for all groups in a specific *dataset*. When *None*, all datases are evaluated
    sequentially.

- `write_yields(dataset=None)`: Writes the yield tables obtained by :py:func:`show_yields` into a file per dataset in the
    table directory. When *dataset* is *None*, all datasets are evaluated sequentially.

- `compare_yields(dataset, group1, group2)`: Compares the yields in a specific *dataset* between *group1* and *group2*.

- `compare_event(dataset, event=None, variables=None, interactive=True)`: Compares *variables* of an *event* given by its id in a specific *dataset*. When *variables* is
    *None*, the variables defined in the configuration are used. When *event* is *None*, all events
    in that dataset compared. In case of multiple events, a prompt allows to either stop or continue
    the comparison when *interactive* is *True*.

- `write_event(dataset, event=None, variables=None)`: Writes the event comparison tables obtained by :py:func:`compare_event` into a file for a
    specific *dataset* and *variables* for a selected *event*. When *None*, the *test_events* list
    in the configuration entry for that dataset is used. *variables* is forwarded to
    :py:func:`compare_event`.

- `check_missing_events(dataset, group1, group2, variables=None, interactive=True)`: Traverses missing events between *group1* and *group2* in a specific *dataset* and prints a
    table with specific *variables* per event. When *variables* is *None*, the variables defined in
    the configuration are used.

- `check_common_events(dataset, groups=None, variables=None, interactive=True)`: Traverses events in a *dataset* that are common to all *groups* and prints a table with specific
    *variables* per event. When *groups* is *None*, all participating groups are selected. When
    *variables* is *None*, the variables defined in the configuration are used. In case of multiple
    events, a prompt allows to either stop or continue the comparison when *interactive* is *True*.

- `compare_variable(dataset, variable, group1, group2, epsilon=1e-05)`: Compares a *variable* in a specific *dataset* between *group1* and *group2* and prints a table
    showing variable values in differing events, i.e., in events where the relative difference
    exceeds *epsilon*.

- `visualize_variable(dataset=None, variables=None, epsilon=1e-05)`: Creates a visualization for a specific *dataset* and *variables* and saves it in the plot
    directory. When *dataset* is *None*, all available datasets are used. When *variables* is
    *None*, the variables defined in the configuration are used.

- `write_all()`: Writes all tables and plots defined in the synchronization tools.

### Note on data handling

To keep the repository small, the actual root input files for comparison should not be committed. Instead, those files can be located on AFS, Dropbox/CERNBox, etc, which are then copied or downloaded to a local directory the first time the synchronization tool is started.
